# Rest Json Serializer

**Description**: Determine which data to send out to the world in the elegant way.

Since I need to write an API backend with NodeJS. I'm trying to find a library for serializing data from the system that has rich functions. For instance rename field, the default value for null, method fields, etc. But, I didn't find it. So, I decided to build it myself.

This project influenced [Django REST framework Serializer](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/)

## Installation
To install this package, run the following command from the root of your project's directory:

`npm i rest-json-serializer`
